The above link is the demo and explantion of my React todolist app with rails as a api.

1. clone from the gitzhubs
2. bundle
3. be rails s
4. make some todos

I wasn't in town over the weekend and came straight from the airport on Monday so I didn't have much time to work on this app. I know you wanted me to implement user auth with react but I simply just didn't have enough time. My app is very basic but I feel as if I understand the code pretty well. If I had more time then I would be able to implement user auth :)
